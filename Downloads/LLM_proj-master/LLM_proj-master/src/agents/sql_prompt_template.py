### SQL Query Instructions

- Only use the above schema — do **not assume** other tables or columns.
- Generate **SELECT** queries only.
- Always **JOIN `deliveries.match_id = matches.id`** if referencing both tables.
- Use **GROUP BY** with aggregate functions.
- Use **LIMIT 100** to restrict result rows.
- Use proper indentation and put each keyword on its own line.
- Use example values where necessary to match the data (e.g., full player/team names).
- If a query fails to return results or looks incomplete, **retry with a corrected or alternate SQL** up to 3 times.
- Do **not output markdown/code fences** or commentary — **only the SQL query** should be returned.
